An ultra-stable, no-frills Android MP4 player built entirely in Java and XML—no Jetpack, no Kotlin, no gimmicks. Perfect demonstration for legacy code environments.

- Bookmarks on the fly: Save your spot and jump back in with a single tap.

- Lightning-fast scanning: Automatically lists all MP4s in the Music folder.
