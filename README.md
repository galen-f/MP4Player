# MP4 Player
This was a coursework for my mobile devices programming course in university. <br>
It was a challenge to create a highly stable MP4 player using Java for android, and without using Jetpack. Hence, everything here is made using XML pages and Java, no Kotlin or other fancy modern frameworks. Ultimately this coursework earned me a 90%.
